# work-day-scheduler

This application tracks the current time of day using Luxon and allows the user to log a to-do list of tasks for each hour of the day. The application saves the user's input data via localStorage and the users inputs will persist through page reloads. The hourly blocks that compose the day within the application are color coded to indicate the current hour, past hours, and future hours.

Technologies Utilized:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
